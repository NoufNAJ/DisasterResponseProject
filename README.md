# DisasterResponseProject
Machine learning project utilizing disaster Response datasets

# Project Motivation
Welcome to the Disaster Response ML Project! This project focuses on implementing an ETL process and a Machine Learning Pipeline to classify tweets and messages. The goal is to aid in disaster emergency response efforts through a Flask Web App.

# Instructions
This project is structured into three main sections:

- Data Processing: Includes building an ETL pipeline to extract data from the source, clean it, and store it in a SQLite database.
= Machine Learning Pipeline: Develops a pipeline capable of classifying tweet text messages into 36 different categories.
- Web Application: Running a web application that displays model results in real-time.

# Installations 
- Python 3.5+
- Machine Learning Libraries: NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn
- Natural Language Processing Libraries: NLTK
- SQLite Database Libraries: SQLAlchemy
- Model Loading and Saving Library: Pickle
- Web App and Data Visualization: Flask, Plotly
